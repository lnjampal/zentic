/**
 * Backfill prompt_result_citations from the raw prompt_results.citations jsonb.
 *
 * Run: `node src/scripts/backfill-citations.js`
 *
 * Options via env:
 *   - CITATIONS_BACKFILL_BATCH   answers pulled per batch (default 200)
 *   - CITATIONS_BACKFILL_DAYS    only answers newer than this many days
 *                                (default: no limit — the whole history)
 *   - CITATIONS_BACKFILL_PAUSE   milliseconds to wait between batches
 *                                (default 100)
 *
 * Pass `--force` to reprocess answers that already have rows. Only needed when
 * the stored rows are wrong rather than missing — a changed normalization rule,
 * say. Without it, answers already covered are skipped without resolving their
 * URLs, which is what makes a repair run take minutes instead of hours.
 *
 * Idempotent and restartable. `persistCitationRows` upserts on
 * `(prompt_result_id, position)` with `ignoreDuplicates`, so re-running skips
 * what is already there, and the walk is keyset-based on `(created_at, id)`
 * rather than OFFSET — a run that is interrupted can simply be started again.
 *
 * Deliberately unhurried. There are ~2M citations to write across ~177k
 * answers on a database that is already 1.1 GB on a 2 GB instance, and this
 * runs against the same instance serving the dashboard. Small batches with a
 * pause between them keep it from evicting the cache that live queries depend
 * on; finishing in twenty minutes instead of five is a good trade.
