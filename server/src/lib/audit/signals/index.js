/**
 * Registry of implemented signal evaluators. Each category file exports its
 * own array; new signals are added there and surface here automatically.
 *
 * Faz 1 implements the 33 deterministic signals (Structure 13, Trust 7,
 * Authority 7, Content 3, E-E-A-T 3) of the 47-signal rubric. The remaining 14
 * need a target query, an LLM judge, or an external lookup (Wikidata / press)
 * and land in later phases. The scorer reports coverage (evaluated / total) so
 * partial implementation never penalizes a page for signals we haven't built.
