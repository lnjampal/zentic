/**
 * Page opportunity detection (#719, Phase 5).
 *
 * Answers two questions per brand: which pages carry commercial weight and
 * get nothing from AI engines, and — for each of those — why. The figures
 * come from `ga_page_ai_visibility`, which aggregates the tables the GA sync
 * (#704) writes and joins the brand's own citations and prompt targeting to
 * them. No model runs in this path and no page is fetched.
 *
 * The ranking signal is chosen from what the property actually reports rather
 * than assumed. A shop with ecommerce ranks on money; a site with no
 * conversion events at all ranks on engagement. The signal used is stored on
 * every finding, because a surface that calls an engagement rank "your most
 * valuable page" is making a true statement about the wrong thing.
 *
 * Ranking and the exclusion list stay here rather than moving into SQL with
 * the aggregation: `isExcludedPath` is shared with the prompt suggestion
 * generator (#705), and a second copy of it in the RPC would drift from this
 * one the first time either is extended. The cost is that every page travels,
 * which is what the paginated read below exists to survive.
 *
 * Deliberately not here: LLM enrichment, clustering, and the acted-on half of
 * the opportunity lifecycle. Those need more volume than one connected
 * property produces, and a finding nobody can verify is worse than one that
 * is merely narrow.
