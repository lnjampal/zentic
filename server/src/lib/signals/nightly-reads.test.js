 * rescan everything a brand has ever collected, and past roughly 25k results
 * that crosses the database's 8s statement timeout. Each has a `_daily`
 * variant answered from the rollup tables, whose cost scales with days in the
 * window instead.
 *
 * This is a grep, and it exists because the alternative failed twice. #829
 * moved the pulse's calls to the rollups and missed the one in the signal
 * recorder, which then threw every night on the largest brand and took the
 * whole pass with it — the second silent multi-day outage from the same
 * cause. A convention nothing checks is a convention that holds until someone
 * adds a call site.
