/**
 * Signal recording (Action Center, observation layer).
 *
 * Converts what the production detectors already find into `signals` rows
 * with a lifecycle. Two inputs, one writer:
 *
 *  - the Daily Pulse metric engine's highlights and warnings (#540) — its
 *    thresholds ARE the noise control: a visibility wobble below the
 *    sharp-drop floor or a one-run citation blip never reaches this module;
 *  - open page-opportunity findings (#719), read from their table.
 *
 * Runs after every stamped daily tracking run, before and independent of the
 * pulse email's own gating — a brand with pulse emails off still gets
 * signals, because the observation layer is a product surface, not a
 * notification preference.
 *
 * Dedup: one row per ongoing condition, keyed by (brand, dedup_key). A
 * re-detection updates last_detected_at and the measured values. A RESOLVED
 * condition that fires again reopens as new; a DISMISSED one stays dismissed
 * — the user said "not relevant", and re-raising it nightly would teach them
 * to ignore the page.
 *
 * Resolution: persistent kinds (a drop, a surge, an open opportunity) are
 * auto-resolved when a run no longer detects them — the condition ended.
 * Event kinds (a first citation, a new engine appearance) describe moments;
 * they never auto-resolve and simply age until triaged.
