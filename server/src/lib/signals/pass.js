/**
 * The nightly signal pass, and the sweep that picks up the ones it lost.
 *
 * Recording signals and consolidating them into actions are two steps of one
 * thing: a night either produced both or produced nothing useful. They were
 * chained inline in the job runner, fire-and-forget, with a `.catch` that
 * logged. That is how the biggest brand went six days without a single signal
 * — every night its metric queries crossed the database's statement timeout,
 * every night the chain threw, and every night the error went into a log file
 * nobody reads while the Action Center quietly showed week-old work.
 *
 * Two things change here. The pass writes a row when it finishes, so "did it
 * run?" is a question the database can answer. And a sweep re-runs the passes
 * that have no row, so a night lost to a timeout, a deploy or an OOM is
 * recovered the next morning instead of never.
 *
 * The daily pulse has had both since #702. This is the same shape for the
 * half of the same trigger that never got it.
