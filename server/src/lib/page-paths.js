/**
 * Which landing pages can carry an AI-visibility opportunity at all (#705,
 * #719).
 *
 * Shared because both surfaces ask the same question and would otherwise
 * answer it differently: the suggestion generator needs "could a prompt lead
 * someone here", and the detection engine needs "is this page worth raising".
 * A page that fails one fails the other, and two copies of this list would
 * drift the first time either is extended.
 *
 * Two groups, excluded for different reasons:
 *
 *   Transactional — checkout, cart, confirmation, login, account. A GA4
 *   purchase event fires on the confirmation page, so without this the
 *   highest-revenue "page" in most shops is /checkout, and no prompt exists
 *   that a person would ask an assistant in order to arrive there.
 *
 *   Non-commercial — careers, legal, privacy. These take real traffic and
 *   real engagement, so they rank, but AI visibility on a job posting does
 *   not move the business the product is measuring. Leaving them in fills
 *   the list with findings nobody will act on.
