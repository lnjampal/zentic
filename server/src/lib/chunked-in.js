/**
 * Splitting a PostgREST `.in(column, ids)` filter across several requests.
 *
 * PostgREST carries `.in(...)` values in the query string, so one filter over
 * N uuids costs about 39 characters of URL each. The Prompts page asks for
 * every volume row a brand owns in a single call, and the largest brand's 402
 * prompts built a 15,792-character request — close enough to the edge's URL
 * ceiling that roughly one call in four was rejected before it ever reached
 * PostgREST. Those attempts left no trace in the database logs, the route
 * could only report that the query had failed, and the page dropped its
 * volume and competition columns with a "temporarily unavailable" toast.
 *
 * Every other brand's equivalent request is under 4 kB and has never failed,
 * so the cure is to keep each request in that range rather than to grow the
 * ceiling. Chunks run in parallel, so the extra round trips cost close to
 * nothing.
 *
 * `server/src/routes/prompts.js` already does this by hand for fan-out intent
 * lookups (`FANOUT_INTENT_LOOKUP_CHUNK`); this is the same idea, shared.
