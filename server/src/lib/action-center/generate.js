/**
 * Action generation (Action Center, prioritization layer).
 *
 * Consolidates a brand's OPEN signals into a handful of actions — many
 * signals → one action, deterministically. A definition names the signal
 * kinds that constitute one outcome; if a brand has six open page
 * opportunities they become ONE "capture AI traffic" action with six linked
 * signals, never six rows. The count of actions therefore follows what the
 * detectors actually found: four important things yield four actions, per
 * the quality-over-quantity rule.
 *
 * This module is the matching engine and knows no definition by name. What
 * exists, what it needs, and what it puts in its payload is each definition's
 * own business — see definitions/index.js. The engine's job is the part every
 * definition shares: match, decide whether a new cycle may open, and write.
 *
 * Lifecycle across nights, mirroring signals:
 *  - an ACTIVE action keeps its scope. Newly detected signals are linked to
 *    it as evidence, but its payload is not rewritten: it is a work package
 *    someone may already be executing against, and silently changing what it
 *    covers is worse than leaving a new problem for the next cycle;
 *  - a CLOSED action — completed or dismissed — is finished. It is never
 *    written to again and never resurrected; it is the historical record of
 *    one execution cycle;
 *  - closing frees the definition's slot. Once the rest window has passed, a
 *    still firing condition opens a NEW action beside the old one, with its
 *    own baseline, tasks and outcome.
 *
 * Two questions, answered in that order (#818 phase 6). *What did we find?*
 * writes a candidate for every definition that matched, every night, whether
 * or not anything can be done about it. *What should we act on?* promotes
 * from that queue. Keeping them apart is what stopped findings disappearing:
 * a condition detected while the slot was busy used to be linked as evidence
 * and then forgotten, because the next cycle was built from whatever happened
 * to be open on the night the slot freed up.
 *
 * Three things stop a candidate being promoted, and they are counted
 * separately so a quiet night is legible: the brand lacks the data the
 * definition needs (`ineligible`), the last cycle closed too recently
 * (`resting`), or the brand has already had its day's worth (`capped`). None
 * of them loses the finding — it stays in the queue, and its wait is what
 * lifts it up the order.
 *
 * `baseline` snapshots the linked signals' measured values at creation —
 * the "before" half of the validation comparison (#818, phase 2).
