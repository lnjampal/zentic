/**
 * The task planner (#818, phase 5).
 *
 * Turns a definition's task spec into the rows one action actually gets,
 * given what the brand has and what the action is about. Two brands with the
 * same problem no longer receive the same list: a brand with analytics
 * connected is asked what the drop cost in sessions; a brand without is not
 * asked a question it cannot answer.
 *
 * Three things happen here, and nothing else — the planner decides the plan,
 * it does not write it. `generate.js` owns the writing, which keeps this
 * testable without a database.
 *
 *  1. **Eligibility.** A task whose required sources the brand lacks is
 *     dropped. Definition-level `requires` on a spec entry narrows further,
 *     which is how a task that exists for every brand can still be optional
 *     inside one particular plan.
 *  2. **Dependencies.** A dropped task takes its name out of everyone's
 *     `dependsOn`. A dependency that is not in the plan is not a dependency —
 *     leaving the name behind would block a task on work nobody was asked to
 *     do.
 *  3. **Targets.** A task that can name what it is about does, from the
 *     action's payload. The values travel as parameters rather than as
 *     resolved text, so the plan stays translatable.
