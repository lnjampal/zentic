/**
 * The tool registry (#818, phase 7).
 *
 * A task that runs automatically does so through exactly one tool, and a tool
 * is the only way anything automated reaches data or a third-party system.
 * That is the point of having a registry rather than letting each task call
 * whatever it likes: what the engine can touch is enumerable, and what it can
 * touch *outside Zentic* is a property declared on the tool rather than a
 * fact discovered afterwards in a log.
 *
 * Each tool declares:
 *
 *  - `source` — the brand source it needs, the same vocabulary the definition
 *    registry and the planner already use. A brand without it never has the
 *    task planned, and the runner refuses anyway;
 *  - `writesExternally` — whether running it *changes* something outside
 *    Zentic. Reading a third-party system is not that: the brand
 *    authorised the analytics connection and we already read it nightly, and
 *    asking for approval before every read would teach people to approve
 *    without looking. What needs a person is a change they would have to
 *    undo. Neither tool here writes, so the flag is false on both — but the
 *    runner enforces it now, while there is nothing to gate, rather than
 *    leaving it to be written later under deadline;
 *  - `version` — bumped when what the tool does changes, recorded on every
 *    run so an old result stays readable against the rules it ran under.
 *
 * Arguments are built by the tool from the action's own payload. Nothing here
 * takes a query, a URL or a property id from anywhere a model could reach —
 * the same rule the GA sync already follows, and the reason this layer can be
 * audited at all.
