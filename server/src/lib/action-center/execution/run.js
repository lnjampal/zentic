/**
 * Carrying out a task automatically (#818, phase 7).
 *
 * Phase 5 marked every task with who could carry it out and whether carrying
 * it out reaches outside Zentic; nothing acted on either. This does, under
 * four rules that are the whole point of the layer:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing reaches outside except through a tool.** The tool registry is
 *     the enumerable surface; a task without a tool is not runnable, and says
 *     so rather than improvising.
 *  2. **Nothing changes outside Zentic without approval.** A tool that
 *     writes to a third-party system is blocked until a person has
 *     authorised that task, and the authorisation is recorded on the task
 *     rather than inferred from whoever happened to trigger the run. Reading
 *     a system the brand connected is not a change and needs no approval —
 *     asking for one before every read teaches people to approve blindly.
 *  3. **Every attempt is recorded** — inputs, tool, result, error. Never the
 *     model's reasoning: that is not evidence, and storing it invites people
 *     to read it as explanation. Recorded twice, for two readers: the audit
 *     table for whoever is debugging the engine, and `action_events` for
 *     whoever owns the action, because a task that completes itself with no
 *     trail is indistinguishable from one a colleague did.
 *  4. **A failed run fails its task, not its action.** A tool that throws
 *     costs one step. The action stays open, the other tasks stay as they
 *     were, and somebody can do that step by hand.
 *
 * `sweepTaskExecution` is the nightly entry point. It is bounded by a ceiling
 * on attempts per night, because both tools read and the cost of a bad night
 * is third-party requests rather than damage — but a detector misfiring across
 * the base should not become a thousand of them before anyone is awake.
