/**
 * Action Engine thresholds — the numbers that decide what counts (#818).
 *
 * Every value here answers a judgement call: how far something has to move
 * before it is a signal, how much evidence is enough to raise an action, how
 * long to wait before believing a measurement. They were scattered across the
 * detectors that used them, which is survivable at a dozen detectors and
 * unmanageable at forty — and phase 3 brings forty. Tuning the engine should
 * mean editing this file, not going hunting.
 *
 * Grouped by the question each number answers rather than by the file that
 * currently reads it, so a later refactor moving a detector does not move its
 * threshold.
 *
 * Resolution order, per the specification: system default → definition
 * default → workspace override. Only the first exists today; `resolve()` is
 * the seam the other two arrive through, so callers already read their
 * thresholds through a function rather than a constant and none of them has
 * to change when they do.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: retry counts, page sizes, poll intervals,
 * display limits. Those are operational choices with one right answer, not
 * product judgements anyone would want to tune per workspace.
