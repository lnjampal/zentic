 * A source scope, expressed as domains `citations_urls` can filter on (#745).
 *
 * The URL list is capped at the top 2,000 by citation count, so a scope
 * applied to the rows that arrived reports a slice of the global top N as
 * though it were the whole scope — 125 competitor URLs on a brand that has
 * 2,794. Pushing the scope into the query means the cap applies inside it.
 *
 * Returns an include list for the two narrow scopes and an *exclude* list for
 * Third-party, which says the same thing in far less space: on the largest
 * brand a window holds 17,532 cited domains, of which fourteen are the
 * brand's own or a competitor's. Naming the fourteen beats sending 17,518.
 *
 * `rows` is the already-classified domain list, so what counts as a brand or
 * competitor domain keeps exactly one definition — `classifyDomain`, applied
 * once, upstream of both tabs. Nothing here re-decides it.
