/**
 * AI Visibility Score — the single source of truth for the blend.
 *
 * score = 100 × (w.mention × mention rate
 *              + w.citation × citation rate
 *              + w.position × position factor)
 *
 * - mention rate / citation rate: share of answers (0..1) naming / citing
 *   the entity — deterministic parse-time detection, no LLM judges.
 * - position factor: mean of 1/mention_position over answers that name the
 *   entity (0..1; 1 = always named first). Null when never named. Before it
 *   enters the blend it is shrunk by the evidence behind it (see
 *   POSITION_SUPPORT_ANSWERS) — a perfect average over a handful of answers
 *   must not outrank entities that actually show up.
 *
 * The same formula applies to ANY answer set — brand-wide, per prompt, per
 * topic, per platform, per day — which is what keeps every surface's number
 * identical for the same scope and window.
 *
 * Mirrors server/src/config/visibility-score.js — keep the two in sync.
