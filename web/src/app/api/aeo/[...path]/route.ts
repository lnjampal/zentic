/**
 * Same-origin proxy to the AEO API server.
 *
 * A handful of client components call the API server directly from the
 * browser (topic/prompt/competitor suggestions, tracking re-analysis). That
 * made every visitor's own network a dependency of the signup funnel: the
 * API host has to resolve *and* be routable from wherever they are. On
 * 2026-08-28 the CDN range it sits on stopped accepting TCP from a Turkish
 * ISP, and onboarding died with "Couldn't fetch topic suggestions right now"
 * for anyone on that network — with no trace in the API server's logs or
 * Supabase's, because the request never left the browser.
 *
 * Routing those calls through this handler means the only host a visitor
 * connects to is the one already serving them the page. The hop to
 * API_BASE_URL happens from our infrastructure instead, where reachability
 * is ours to guarantee.
 *
 * The upstream path is forwarded verbatim, so `/api/aeo/api/topics/suggest`
 * reaches `${API_BASE_URL}/api/topics/suggest` and server routes still line
 * up one-to-one with what the browser asked for.
 *
 * Auth is unchanged: the caller's Supabase bearer token rides through and
 * the API server authorizes it exactly as before. This handler adds no
 * authority of its own — it forwards, it does not authenticate.
