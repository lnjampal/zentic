# Consuming Ansvisor Design System in web apps

Read `docs/AGENTS.md` first. This guide covers
React/Vite and other shadcn/Tailwind web consumers. If the app already contains
a local theme or component library, also read
`docs/migrating-web.md` before writing UI.

For Next.js, also read `docs/consuming-nextjs.md`. This package exports typed
TypeScript source, not precompiled JavaScript. Vite handles it automatically;
Next.js must include it in `transpilePackages`. Use TypeScript 5 with bundler
module resolution and React JSX enabled. React remains a peer dependency.

Public props can be imported directly (for example `ButtonProps`) or inferred
with `React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>`. UI components and hooks are client
boundaries; tokens and `cn` are also usable in server code.

## Theme

Load DM Sans (400–700), Manrope (500–800), and DM Mono (400–500) in the
consumer's HTML using this font stylesheet:
`https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Mono:wght@400;500&family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Manrope:wght@500;600;700;800&display=swap`.
Use `font-heading` for heading-style text that is not a semantic heading.
The package applies the heading stack to h1–h6 automatically.

Import this package's theme once from the app's main CSS:

```css
@import "@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/styles.css";
```

`styles.css` already imports Tailwind, its plugins, and this package's token
theme. It also registers this package's component sources. Do not add a separate
Tailwind import or a `node_modules` source path in a Tailwind v4 consumer.
Tailwind v3 consumers keep their existing `@tailwind` directives and add
`node_modules/@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/src/components` to `content`.

## Components and helpers

Import every provided primitive, `cn`, and toast API directly from this package:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/components/ui/button";
import { cn } from "@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/lib/utils";
import {
  toast,
  useToast,
} from "@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/hooks/use-toast";
```

Use the package component whenever it provides the required family. Keep
product-specific compositions in the app, but compose them from package
primitives rather than recreating those primitives locally.

The packaged `Toaster` and toast hook share one in-memory store. Do not call a
local toast hook while rendering the packaged `Toaster`.

## Verify

After wiring the workspace dependency, import and render
`@workspace/ansvisor-design-system/components/ui/button`. Run the app's typecheck
and dev server. The import must resolve and the Button must use this package's
theme before broader UI work begins.

## Ongoing rules

- Keep one source of theme variables.
- Import package-provided primitives and helpers from the package path.
- Add reusable product-agnostic components to this package first.
- For a non-shadcn app, use the tokens as the source of truth and adapt existing
  components to the token CSS variables without copying token values.
