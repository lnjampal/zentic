-- Put the org-membership guard on the five reachable citation RPCs (#779).
--
-- All five are `security definer` and cannot stop being so: they read
-- `citation_urls`, a cross-tenant dictionary with no select policy of its own,
-- so an invoker-rights version would return nothing to anyone. Definer rights
-- mean RLS is not consulted at all, and the only thing standing between an
-- authenticated caller and another organization's citation data was the web
-- tier passing the right `p_brand_id`. Practical exposure was small — brand
-- ids are unguessable uuids and the payloads are aggregates — but the tenant
-- boundary belongs in the database, where `report_citation_evidence` (00063)
-- and the gap functions (00068) already put it.
--
-- The guard is their `allowed` CTE, unchanged: a non-member's scan filters to
-- nothing rather than raising, so the page renders its empty state instead of
-- an error. `citation_url_ids` shares the definer pattern but carries no
-- `authenticated` grant, so it is unreachable and left alone.
--
-- Bodies are otherwise identical to 00061 and 00067 — the guard is the only
-- change, and a member's results are byte-for-byte what they were.
--
-- One consequence worth stating: `auth.uid()` is null under the service role,
-- so a service-role caller now reads empty. Nothing calls these that way today
-- (the five have exactly one caller, `web/src/lib/actions/citations.ts`, and
-- every call site uses the user-session client; the MCP layer runs its own
-- queries behind its own ownership check, and `server/src` never touches
-- them). A future service-role caller has to come through a user context or
-- change this deliberately — the comments below say so.
