-- Action Engine, phase 6 (#818): what the engine found but could not act on.
--
-- One active action per definition is the right rule — a brand should not be
-- handed the same piece of work twice — but it left nowhere for a second
-- finding to go. Phase 1 stopped it corrupting the open action's scope, which
-- fixed the damage without fixing the loss: a condition detected while the
-- slot was busy was linked as evidence and then forgotten, because the next
-- cycle is built from whatever happens to be open on the night the slot frees
-- up. Anything that resolved in between was simply never worked on.
--
-- A candidate is the waiting room. Every definition that matches signals
-- accumulates one; promotion is what turns it into an action, subject to the
-- slot being free, the rest window having passed, and the day's budget. The
-- generator therefore no longer decides what becomes an action while it is
-- still deciding what was found — those are two questions and they now have
-- two answers.

  'The queue of findings waiting to become actions. One waiting row per (brand, definition); promotion turns the highest-priority into an action when the slot, the rest window and the daily cap allow.';
comment on column public.action_candidates.priority is
  'Score at the last pass. Impact, weight of evidence, and how long it has waited — see config/action-engine.js.';
