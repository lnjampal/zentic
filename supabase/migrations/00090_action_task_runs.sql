-- Action Engine, phase 7 (#818): what an automated task actually did.
--
-- Phase 5 marked every task with who could carry it out and whether carrying
-- it out reaches outside Zentic. Nothing acted on either. This is the layer
-- that does, and the first thing it needs is a record — because an automated
-- step nobody can audit is worse than a manual one nobody automated.
--
-- One row per attempt, successful or not. Attempts are kept rather than
-- overwritten: a task that failed twice and then worked is a different story
-- from one that worked first time, and the difference is the one an operator
-- needs.
--
-- What is deliberately NOT stored: the model's reasoning. Inputs, the tool
-- called, its arguments, its result and any error — those are the record.
-- Chain-of-thought is not evidence, it is not reliable as explanation, and
-- exposing it invites people to treat it as either. Anything a run wants to
-- claim it must claim in `output`, where the next task can read it.
