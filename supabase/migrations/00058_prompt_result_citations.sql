-- Citations as rows (#732), phase 1: the tables and the write path.
--
-- `prompt_results.citations` holds the provider's citation array as jsonb.
-- Reading it means expanding every answer on every page load: on the largest
-- brand, 51,679 answers become 679,304 citation entries, and pulling the host
-- out of each URL costs 4.4s of the 4.6s an aggregate over that window takes —
-- above the 8s statement timeout once anything else is asked for. The Citations
-- page works around it by paging the raw rows out to the app tier instead: 50
-- sequential requests carrying 65 MB of jsonb, capped at 50,000 rows, which
-- silently truncates that same brand at 51,679.
--
-- Expanding once at write time turns that into an ordinary indexed read.
--
-- Two tables rather than one, because the naive shape does not fit. Across the
-- database there are 2,023,979 citation entries but only 449,559 distinct URLs
-- — the expensive part (url ~92 bytes, title ~63) repeats 4.5 times on
-- average. One row per citation with the text inline measures 513 MB of heap
-- against 262 MB split this way, and the instance has 2 GB of RAM to hold a
-- database that is already 1.1 GB.
--
-- Phase 1 only fills the tables; nothing reads them yet. The Citations page
-- keeps using the jsonb until phase 2 lands the aggregate RPC, so the two can
-- be compared against each other before anything switches over.

comment on table public.prompt_result_citations is
  'One row per citation per answer (#732). Written alongside prompt_results by the tracking worker and the Cloro webhook handler, and backfilled by server/src/scripts/backfill-citations.js. Source of truth for the Citations page from phase 2 onward; prompt_results.citations remains the raw archival copy.';
comment on table public.citation_urls is
  'Deduplicated URL dictionary for prompt_result_citations. Cross-tenant by design: the same page is cited for many brands, and storing the text once is what keeps the citation table a quarter of the size it would otherwise be.';
comment on column public.prompt_result_citations.position is
  'Index within prompt_results.citations. With prompt_result_id it is the natural key that makes re-running the write path or the backfill idempotent.';
