# Zentic — Open-Source AI Search Intelligence Platform

**[Official Website](https://www.zentic.ai/)** · **[Documentation](https://docs.zentic.ai/)**

**Business Data + AI Behavior → Intelligence → Opportunities → Actions**

Zentic is an **open-source AI Search Intelligence Platform** that helps brands understand, measure, and improve their visibility across AI Search.

Connect business data and traditional search signals with AI Search behavior across ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Google AI Mode, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, Grok, and other AI platforms to discover opportunities, prioritize what matters, and improve brand visibility.

Track prompts, mentions, citations, competitors, AI traffic, and the sources AI systems rely on — all in one platform.

Self-host Zentic for free or use the managed [Zentic Cloud](https://www.zentic.ai/).

We're building Zentic in the open because we believe companies shouldn't need another black box to understand a black box.

Our goal is to make AI Search intelligence more transparent, measurable, actionable, and accessible.

> ⭐ **If you believe AI Visibility should be open and community-driven, star the repo — it's how the next team discovers Zentic.**

## Why Zentic?

AI Search is changing how people discover, evaluate, and choose brands, making Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), and AI SEO increasingly important for improving brand visibility in AI-generated answers.

Traditional search data tells you how people find you through search engines. AI Search introduces another layer: how AI systems understand your brand, which sources they trust, when they mention or cite you, how competitors appear, and which prompts influence discovery.

Zentic brings these signals together.

With Zentic, you can:

- **Monitor Answer Engine Insights & AI Visibility** — Track how your brand appears, performs, and is represented across leading AI platforms.
- **Discover Prompts** — Find relevant prompt opportunities using Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Keyword Planner, and AI systems.
- **Track Prompts** — Monitor the questions and conversations that matter to your audience and measure your visibility over time.
- **Analyze Citations** — Discover which domains, URLs, competitors, and third-party sources AI systems cite.
- **Track Mentions** — Understand when, where, and how AI systems talk about your brand, products, and services.
- **Benchmark Competitors** — Compare your visibility, citations, mentions, and share of voice with competitors.
- **Understand AI Traffic** — Connect AI Search visibility with visits and performance on your website.
- **Discover Query Fan-Outs** — Explore the supporting queries AI systems may generate and use before producing an answer.
- **Find Content Opportunities** — Identify content gaps, optimization opportunities, and topics based on real AI Search behavior.
- **Audit AI Discoverability** — Analyze technical and content signals that can affect how AI systems discover, understand, and retrieve your website.
- **MCP Server** — Connect Zentic's AI Search intelligence with AI assistants and agent workflows through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The result is a clearer path from fragmented data to useful intelligence:

**Business Data + AI Behavior → Intelligence → Opportunities → Actions**

## Built in the Open

AI Search is still evolving, and we don't believe its measurement and optimization should happen behind another black box.

We're building Zentic together with our open-source community around a few simple principles:

- **Evidence over dogma**
- **Measurement over assumptions**
- **Transparency over black boxes**
- **Outcomes over vanity metrics**
- **Collaboration over closed innovation**

Developers, marketers, SEO/AEO/GEO practitioners, researchers, agencies, and companies are welcome to contribute.

You can help by:

- Reporting issues
- Suggesting features
- Opening pull requests
- Testing new releases
- Improving documentation
- Sharing feedback

## Building the Open Future of AI Search

AI Search shouldn't become another ecosystem where companies have to rely entirely on opaque tools, unexplained scores, and assumptions.

We're building Zentic to help companies understand what happens between a user's prompt and an AI-generated answer — from the questions people ask and the sources AI systems use to citations, mentions, competitors, traffic, and opportunities.

Our goal is to move beyond visibility monitoring toward intelligence that helps teams understand **where opportunities exist, why they matter, and what to improve next.**

**Business Data + AI Behavior → Intelligence → Opportunities → Actions**

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (for the web app)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project (free tier works)

### Required Services

| Service | Purpose | Where to get |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Supabase** | Database, Auth, API | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) |
| **AI Provider** (at least one) | Brand tracking across AI engines | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) / [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) / [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) |
| **Cloro** | Web scraping for AI platform responses | [cloro.ai](https://cloro.ai/) |

### Optional Services

| Service | Purpose | Where to get |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **DataForSEO** | Keyword volume data for prompt analysis | [dataforseo.com](https://dataforseo.com/) |
| **Scrape.do** | Page fetching for Site Audit (proxy + JS render); required only if you use Site Audit | [scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) |
| **Stripe** | Payments (cloud mode only, not needed for self-hosted) | [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/) |

### Setup

#### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zentic/zentic.git
cd zentic

cp web/.env.example web/.env.local
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit both `.env` files and fill in your credentials. See the comments in each file for guidance.

#### 2. Set up the database

Run the migration SQL to create all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and triggers:

**Option A — Supabase Dashboard (fresh install, one paste):**
1. Go to your project's **SQL Editor**
2. Paste the contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) — the full schema (every migration in one file) — and click **Run**

**Option B — Supabase CLI:**

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_REF>
npx supabase db push
```

> `supabase/schema.sql` is a generated convenience for **fresh** installs. The numbered files under `supabase/migrations/` stay the source of truth and the **upgrade** path — an existing install adds only the new migration(s) (or `db push`). Regenerate the consolidated file after adding a migration with `bash supabase/build-schema.sh`.

##### Demo data (local only)

For local development, `supabase/seed.sql` ships a small fixture (one demo org, brand, prompts, ~120 prompt results across all tracked engines, competitors, content opportunities, AI traffic logs). It runs automatically the next time you do:

```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

Sign in with **`demo@zentic.local` / `demo123`** and you'll land on a populated dashboard — no provider API keys needed to iterate on UI. The seed only runs against a local Supabase via the CLI; hosted projects are unaffected.

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd web && yarn install && cd ..
cd server && npm install && cd ..
```

#### 4. Start dev servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — frontend
cd web && yarn dev          # http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 — backend
cd server && npm run dev    # http://localhost:80
```

### Docker

```bash
# Configure env files first, then:
docker compose up --build
```

### Self-hosted vs Cloud

Set `IS_CLOUD=false` (default) in `server/.env` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_CLOUD=false` in `web/.env.local` for self-hosted mode. All features are unlocked automatically — no Stripe or payment setup needed.

## What's next

What we're planning to build next. React with 👍 on the linked issue (or open a new one) to push something up the list. PRs welcome on any of these.

- [x] **Zentic MCP server** — expose insights through a Model Context Protocol server so Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, and any other MCP client can query your brand visibility directly. Remote (Streamable HTTP) endpoint at `/api/mcp` — zero install, paste a URL + API key into your client and you're done. Ships with `list_brands` and `get_visibility_summary` today; more tools landing as we go.
- [x] **Anthropic Skills** — opinionated AEO knowledge that turns Claude into an analyst on your account. Ships in two flavours: an MCP-tool flavour for Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor / Zed, and a standalone REST flavour for claude.ai web (no MCP required). First skill (`zentic-aeo-coach`) is live — see [`skills/`](./skills). More (page-audit, rewrite-for-aeo, content-brief) on the way.
- [x] **In-product conversational AI assistant** — chat with your dashboard about visibility trends, competitor moves, and content gaps without leaving the page
- [ ] **ScrapeLLM integration** — add ScrapeLLM as an alternative scraping backend alongside Cloro for users who prefer it or need a fallback
- [x] **PostHog integration** — pipe AI-referred sessions and tracking events into PostHog for users already running it as their product analytics layer
- [x] **Daily Pulse** — a per-brand daily digest email after each tracking run: KPI strip, highlights (first citations, prompt gains, leaderboard overtakes) and anomaly warnings (sharp visibility drops, competitor surges, lost citations), plus a `daily_pulse.created` webhook event for Slack/Notion delivery ([#540](https://github.com/zentic/zentic/issues/540))
- [ ] **BYO LLM keys** — bring your own OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini API key for tracking and content generation, so you control cost and data handling
- [ ] **Webhook recipe library** — one-click Notion / Linear / Asana / Slack templates so a Content Brief can land in your editorial workflow with zero glue code
